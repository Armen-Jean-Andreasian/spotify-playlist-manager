# Playlist manager

Principle: You give a question. The app will show each song and ask you does the song satisfy the question.
You answer y/n. This way you will purify your playlist.
Once all songs have been asked, the program will create two files: to_keep.txt and to_remove.txt


1. Download the playlist as csv file (example https://exportify.net/)
2. Initalize the PlaylistManager class with the playlist, and question.

By the way, PyPI would give higher performance than CPython for this task.
